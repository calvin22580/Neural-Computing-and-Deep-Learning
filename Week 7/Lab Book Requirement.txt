Lab Logbook requirement:

1. Plot graphs for Accuracy and Loss Function for VGG16 and VGG19 (4 graphs in total).
2. Based on this analysis, determine the optimal number of epochs for training your VGG16 model.

3. Add the final Performance Table

4. Plot the performance comparing histogram of VGG16 and VGG19
